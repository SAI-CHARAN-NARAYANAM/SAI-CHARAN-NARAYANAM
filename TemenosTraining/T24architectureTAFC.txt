untilT24 Architecture Evolution.
***************************
A. client server architecture
------------------------------
a.T24 is previously called as GLOBUS which has client-server Architecture.
b.database used in GLOBUS is uniVerse,an IBM product which is installed in application server.
c.so the client used terminal emulation software to connect to the software.
d.a Terminal Emulation software is a Text terminal such as command line interface.
e. all client machines are connected to globus server using telnet protocol
f. when you login to globus you will see character user interface which is also called as CLASSIC.
   which is used to login to browser.
g. after Login you will see Application Prompt where enter the application names to perform action
--------------------------------------------------------
B. JBASE
--------------------------------------------------------
a. globus now moved away from character user interface to Graphical user interface called GLOBUS DESKTOP
b. GLOBUS DESKTOP is written in VISUAL BASIC programming language.
c. there should be a physical connection to connect with GLOBUS DESKTOP server
d. and the connection is TELNET CONNECTION.
e. client machines has to be deployed GLOBUS DESKTOP without any business logic and can access data
 
until R7 release we used GLOBUS DESKTOP after that we used CLASSIC INTERFACE and WEB BROWSER to access T24.

from R04 release onwards T24 drastically changed. 
----------------------------------------------------
C.T24 architecture:
----------------------------------------------------
a. a web browser software like internet explorer or mozilla firefox can now be used as USER INTERFACE
b. due to this there are many layers added to T24 Architecture.
c. T24 is now intranet based Browser solution
d. front-end to T24 is now T24 Browser.
e. any request coming from browser will be forwarded to T24 application server.
f. there are four layers in T24 Architecture
   i. Client- 
   ii. Webserver Layer - this will have Web applications like mozilla. it will accept the request and sends back the response
   iii.Application Server Layer- it will have T24 software and it will process the request and sends the response to web server
   iv. Database Server Layer. - it will store the results and T24 data.
 --------------------------------------
D.ADVANTAGES:
---------------------------------------
a. Stateless Connection
b. Resilience
c. Scalability
d. Ease of Deployement
--------------------------------------------------------------------
D.MULTI-TIER ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------------
Layers in multi-tier Architecture
---------------------------------------
a. client
   a.1. Web Browser
	-this layer will have Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox to recieve input from client
------------
b. Web Server Layer
   b.1. Web Server Software- it will handle http request coming from browser and respond with a http response
   b.2. T24 Browser Servlet- it will contain T24 browser logic. it converts HTTP into BroserXML request and passes to temenos connector client
   b.3. Temenos Connector Client - this will forward the request to T24 Application Server
-------------
c. Temenos Application Server Layer
   c.1. Temenos Connector Server - this is written in java. this uses Temenos Server Session to send request to T24
   c.2. T24 Runtime- it refers to T24 Business Logic it comes with OFS Module
   c.3. JBASE- it provides runtime to T24 which has JBASE BASIC language used for local Development
   c.4. Direct Connect Drivers- it is used to communicate to external database
-------------
d. Database Server Layer
   d. Oracle/DB2. these are the databases where T24 data will reside in XML format
--------------------------------------------
*******************************************
T24 can handle three message formats they are
a. BrowserXML
b.OFSML
c.OFS
-------------------
*Network Dispatcher:
-this is third party software used to distribute HTTP requests to web servers.
-it is also known as Load Balancer. it will eliminate single point failure
-------------------
*MQ:
Message Queuing : it enables storing and forwarding the messages
-this will present in between TCC(Temenos Connector Client) and TCS(Temenos Connector Server)
mgput(tcc posts request to mq) and mgget(tcs gets request from mq)
