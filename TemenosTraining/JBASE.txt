jBASE Database & Administration:
----------------------------------
a. Jbase is a Post Relational Database Management System.it supports multi value and subvalue
b. they are non fixed length
c. the development environment for jbase is called jbase BASIC
d.jBASE is used to create compile and execute programs
e.the extension of operation system is jsh(jshell) provided by jBase.
f. jBase is an open database. it can communicate with other databases using Direct Connect Drivers
g. it uses c compiler to compile code
-----------------------------------
Architecture of T24 Application Server
----------------
a. the first layer is Unix,windows Operating System
b. Jbase is installed above operating system
c. T24 is installed above jBase
d. user can use terminal emulation software or T24 Browser
----------------------------
TAFC Directory Structure:
-------------------------
jBase<release.no>
a. bin:
contains all the binary executables that makeup the TAFC including compilers
--
b. config:
contains various configuration files relating to jPML daemon 
for creating library files and other configuration files.
--
c. lib:
contains library files that are required for working in TAFC.these files contain 
all the library files required for linking and executing jBC- compiled routines.
--
d. tmp:
this is general purpose temporary directory for runtime use
--
e. jspooler:
this is a spool directory of TAFC
it contains all the files that are required for spooling to work in tafc
this file is created as a part of the printer setup of TAFC
we have to create this directory manually.
--
-----------------------------------------------------
basic navigation of TAFC:
-------------------------
a. BK  	   :- from globus gets you down to jsh prompt with permission.
b. jsh>pwd :- print working directory
c. ls/JDIR :- list files and directory under current directory
d. ls-l    :- list files and directories, and thier permissions
e. more    :- used with file name to display contents of the file
f. cd	   :- move to directory or file
g. exit    :- exits unix
-------------------------------------
to change permissions of a file commands are:
----------
a. $chmod 777 directory	  : changes permission to rwxrwxrwx
b. $chmod-r 777 directory : all permissions to all files in this directory and sub directories
c. $chmod666*		  : as above excluding subdirectories
-------------------------------------
*jBASE contains programs,subroutoines and files.
environment variables define where to find the above.
Environmental Variables used to:
a. locate files
b. establish search paths
c. locate programs
d. locate subroutines
e. locate spooler files
------------------
a. echo  :- it shows contents of an environment variable
		ex: echo$HOME
---
b. env   :- shows all environment variables
---
c. jdiag :- shows all the environmental variables from a jBASE perspective
		ex: jdiag -vl
---
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* after supplying valid user name and password when they logon to the server , a port number is assigned to each user
*jBASE assigns port when user logs in , port number are picked from "port o-499" which is present in $JBASERELEASEDIR/proc
------
jBASE features:
----------------
a. can store variable length records
b. unlimited number of files
c. most efficient method of data storage,access and retrieval
---

* whenever we logon to T24 running on jBASE, remote.cmd or .profile is executed
-------------------------
jBASE Directory Structure:
-------------------------
a. bin : executable files
b. config : configuration files
c. jspooler : spooling files
d. lib : library files
e. tmp : temporary files

------------------------------------
JSHELL:
-------
it provides a command line environment 
*
features:
---------
a. easily customizable
b. easy command recall
--------------
commands:
---------
a. jdir : list of files in a directory
b. jrm : removes a file
c. jmv : moves old file to new file
-------------------
jBASE environment variables:
-------------------
a. jdiag : shows all environment variables from jBASE perspective
b. echo  : shows the contents of an environment variable
c. JBCRELEASEDIR : path to JBASE directory
d. JBCGLOBALDIR  : path to the jBASE directory where various configuration files are found 
e. JBCSPOOLERDIR : contains path of the spooler directory
f. PATH 	 : search path locating executables. contains search path for os executables.
		   contains compiler executables.	
g. JBCBASETMP 	 : contains the path of JBASE temp directory that stores temporary files 
h. JBCLISTFILE   : contains path of savedlists
 --------------------------
FILE TYPES:
---------------------------
*jbase has two types of files.
a. hashed files
b. non-hashed file
----------------------------
NON-HASHED FILES:
-----------------
a. contains sequential files
b. unix level directories
c. it is used to store programs or generated reports
d. name cannot exceed 255 chars
e. it has only one type. i.e., UD
----------------------------------------
HASHED FILES:
----------------------------------------
a. data files are stored as hash file
b. it uses hash algorithm to dynamically read and write data
c. two types (i) type J3 and (ii) type J4
d. all t24 data files are Hashed files of type J4.
----------------------------------------------------
*every file in jBASE contains two parts 
a. data portion : contains records
b. dictionary portion : contains fieldname and properties
-----------------------------------------------------
MODULO AND SEPARATION:
-----------------------
a. modulo : the data and dictionary portion of hashed files are divided into groups
	     default size of one modulo in J3 is 1024 bytes and for J4 it is 4096
b. Separation: the size of modulo is determined by separation. it is the multiplying factor of modulo
---------------------------
JQL:
---
JQL is a jBASE query language which allows to retrieve data from database in a 
structured order and to present data in a flexible and easily understood format.
it is used to process the data in the database and to generate reports.
they are
a. record selection for processing
b. report formatting
c. sorting
d. data field manipulation capabilities
-----------------------------------
JQL statements
--------------
a. LIST: 
   I. list: to list all the records in a file for the given fields
	ex: LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER 
   
   II. list file fields: LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER MNEMONIC SHORT.NAME NAME.1
   
   III. explicit list: this list will select only those records which are given explicitly
	ex: LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER "100100" "100400"

   IV. list specific records: LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER WITH NAME.1 = "VAR1""VAR2"
        LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER WITH NAME1 = "VAR1" AND WITH SHORT.NAME = "VAR2"
        LIST FBNK.CUSTOMER WITH NAME.1 LIKE "S..."
--------
b. SORT:
   I.Sort: will sort in ascending order by default and if we want to do i descending order 
	we have to eplicitly enter the details
   II. Sort file field by field:
       ex: SORT FBNK.CUSTOMER BY NAME.1 NAME.2
  	   SORT FNK.CUSTOMER BY -DSND NAME.1
   III. BREAK-ON:
         SORT FBNK.CUSTOMER BY NAME.1 BREAK-ON NAME.1
	 *this command will insert a break each time the value in the Break-on field changes
 -------------------------
c. COUNT: this command is used to count the total number of records in a file
---------
d. SUPPRESS : DET-SUPP, details suppress
	      ID-SUPP, suppress the record ID from being displayed at first field
------------
e. ESEARCH : this command will search for string RADAR in globus BP
--------------------------------------------------------------------
UTILITIES
-------------------
a. COMO: it is used to record the details which takes place in the terminal
         directory : &COMO&
	 during COB process, COMO will be initiated automatically and records agent details
b. WHERE: it displays the details of processes executing jbase programs 
c. WHO: displays port number and current process
d. AUTOLOGOUT: it enables a session to be logout automatically
		ex: AUTOLOGOUT -n ; n represents number of minutes
e. CT : it displays record from a file in a terminal.
	ex: CT <filename><record.id>
f. SHOW-ITEM-LOCKS: it displays details of items that are locked in jbase hashed files 
			ex: SHOW-ITEM-LOCKS
g. CLEAR-ITEM-LOCKS: it clears a specific or all locks against specific file and only used with jbase hashed file

-------------------
TOOLS:
---------------
a. JSHOW: 
   used to find data files,programs and subroutines
   syntax: jshow -options name
           a. displays subroutine names in a shared objects
	   c. display compile time and source file
	   f. file name search only
	   h. display help for jshow
           p. program name only search
           s. subroutine name only search
